Another important metric you should learn after learning AUC is log loss. In case
of a binary classification problem, we define log loss as:
Log Loss = - 1.0 * ( target * log(prediction) + (1 - target) * log(1 - prediction) )
Where target is either 0 or 1 and prediction is a probability of a sample belonging
to class 1.
For multiple samples in the dataset, the log-loss over all samples is a mere average
of all individual log losses. One thing to remember is that log loss penalizes quite
high for an incorrect or a far-off prediction, i.e. log loss punishes you for being very
sure and very wrong.
